### Description

This Code Get's The Mp3ID3 Tag. It Also lets you write to the Tag. It has perfect support for the Genre Part, and it's well commented. I know there already are code that does this, but they either dont let you write, or they dont support the Genre part. so here it is, email me for a .exe that demonstrates this module.(Now Includes Project for demo)
